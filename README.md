# Tiny-Eater8Bit
 Ben Eater 8-bit breadboard computer emulator for the Atmel ATtiny84 microcontroller

---

# What you need:
* Microchip Studio (formerly known as Atmel Studio)
* A programming tool that is compatible with Microchip Studio. I used a PICkit 4 but an Atmel ICE will work too.
* An ATtiny84 microcontroller
* An LCD that uses the Hitachi HD44780 controller chip (Note: not compatible with I2C/SPI versions of the same screen)
